Pikachu has expendable charges called static
You start with three charges and gain back one any time a character dies (will be nerfed in 3p+)
Static is activated by having attack pressed on the eighth frame of specific moves
Static DownB immediately uses the second half
Static UpB does more damage and kb (only on the first dash)
Static SideB sets a location that pikachu will be teleported back to next time sideB is pressed
Static NeutralB makes a infinite length attack that stuns
Static Side Taunt heals 25%
UpAir has less end lag
Fair is a bit larger
FTilt freezes
DownTaunt gives pikachu a gun. BE AFRAID.
DownTilt Semi-Spikes
UpAir is faster and comes out faster
